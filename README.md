To our knowledge we're **the only company in the world** that can perform 3D liveness check and [identity concealment](https://www.doubango.org/SDKs/face-liveness/docs/Identity_concealment.html) detection from a single 2D image. We outperform [the competition](https://www.doubango.org/SDKs/face-liveness/docs/Testing_the_competition.html) ([FaceTEC](https://www.doubango.org/SDKs/face-liveness/docs/Testing_the_competition.html#facetec), [BioID](https://www.doubango.org/SDKs/face-liveness/docs/Testing_the_competition.html#bioid), [Onfido](https://www.doubango.org/SDKs/face-liveness/docs/Testing_the_competition.html#onfido), [Huawei](https://www.doubango.org/SDKs/face-liveness/docs/Testing_the_competition.html#huawei)...) in speed and accuracy. **Our implementation is Passive/Frictionless and only takes few milliseconds.**

[Identity concealment](https://www.doubango.org/SDKs/face-liveness/docs/Identity_concealment.html) detects when a user tries to partially hide his/her face (e.g. 3D realistic mask, dark glasses...) or alter the facial features (e.g. heavy makeup, fake nose, fake beard...) to impersonate another user.

**A facial recognition system without liveness detector is just useless.**

We can detect and block all known spoofing attacks: `Paper Print, Screen, Video Replay, 3D (silicone, paper, tissue...) realistic face mask, 2D paper mask, Concealment...`

The next [video](https://youtu.be/4irfRCiOx1w) ([https://youtu.be/4irfRCiOx1w](https://youtu.be/4irfRCiOx1w)) shows a stress test on our implementation using different type of attacks:

Our passive (frictionless) face liveness detector uses SOTA (State Of The Art) deep learning techniques and can be freely tested with your own images at https://www.doubango.org/webapps/face-liveness/
